To start the application, run:

bundle exec rails server
```
## API's testing steps

Requirements:

* Install postman

Usage:

## Deployment

In `config/deploy` you will find a sample file. Copy `production.rb.sample` to `production.rb` and change it accordingly. Deploy using:
 
```
bundle exec cap production deploy
```

## Deploy advice
As we remove bower to manage front dependencies, now it's necesary to change it at Heroku. Apparently, only owner can do it. So for the moment we need a fake bower.json file in order the deploy to work. Please, don't remove it before Heroku is fixed.
