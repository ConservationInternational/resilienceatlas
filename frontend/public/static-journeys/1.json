            "content": "<p>Ethiopia is the fifth largest producer of maize in Africa. The vast majority of maize production in Ethiopia (94%) is done by smallholder farmers, nearly all of whom rely on seasonal rains to support their crops.</p><p>Ethiopia has two distinct rainy seasons and one dry season. The short rainy season, or belg, occurs from February to May and the long rainy season, or kiremt, from June through September.</p><p>Changes in the seasonal rains can greatly impact food security. In 2015, a late start to the short rains in some areas of the country forced many farmers to plant crops more suited for a shorter growing season instead of maize, limiting output of a vital food source, and reducing the resilience of smallholder farmers to future challenges.</p>",
