Climatic changes such as rising temperatures, changes in the amount and timing of precipitation, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and pests/diseases will impact cotton growth during its developmental stages.</p><p>Nearly 75% of the world’s cotton relies on some form of irrigation. A water intensive crop, cotton requires adequate water to grow and prevent heat stress. It thrives in warm temperatures ranging from 32-42 degrees Celcius to grow. The crop also needs a dry period during boll formation that could be impacted by unexpected rains and flooding at this stage.</p>",
