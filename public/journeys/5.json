            "content": "<p> The population of Madagascar relies heavily on their natural resources to support their livelihoods. These resources are essential for adapting to a changing climate to build resilience. Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect smallholder farmers worldwide <a href='http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1639/20130089'> (Harvey et al., 2014)</a> due to changes in rainfall and temperature that are likely to give rise to delays in the timing of planting during the growing seasons, increased pest outbreaks and impacts to water availability. Soil degradation resulting from rapid deforestation that has removed nearly 40% of the countries forest cover since 1940 <a href='http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1639/20130089'> (Harvey et al., 2014)</a>. These challenges contribute to the overall food insecurity of the country. Coastal communities are threatened by a decrease in protective coral reefs and mangroves, exacerbating the negative impacts of eroding shorelines, rising seas levels and powerful storm surges.</p><p> Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) is the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change <a href='https://www.cbd.int/cop/cop-11/doc/2012-10-24-advanced-unedited-cop-11-decisions-en.pdf'> (CBD, 2009)</a>. An EbA project consists of the following elements: 1) the design and implementation addresses at least one climate change impact; 2) the activities include conservation, restoration, and/or biodiversity to help people adapt to climate change; and 3) the outcomes relate to improved livelihoods and/or increased resiliency of people to climate change <a href='http://www.conservation.org/projects/Pages/adapting-to-climate-change-ecosystem-based-adaptation.aspx'> (CI, 2015)</a>. An example relevant to Madagascar is the conservation, restoration and/or management of mangrove forests which protects coastal communities from climate impacts such as sea level rise or coastal storm surges, while providing fish habitat, improving food security and promoting stable income generation. One major question facing the country is how main staples, such as rice, will be impacted from projected climate change, and what can be done to increase the resiliency of the populations to these impacts.</p>",

The Government of Madagascar is reviewing different approaches to addressing this challenge via their National Adaptation Plan (NAP). Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) can be integrated within the NAP to harness the potential of ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. Current work in Madagascar identifies water quality and quantity as an important function across all sectors. Increased variability of precipitation makes it more difficult for farmers to predict the ideal time to plant. Flooding can damage infrastructure and increase soil erosion, leading to siltation of waterways. Increased dry period shortens the growing season and could lead to declines in harvests. Increased temperatures can lead to heat stress in plants. This in turn leads to a decline in health and livelihoods and can impact the unique flora and fauna that makes Madagascar a famous ecological tourist destination. Together with Conservation International, the Madagascar Government sectoral ministries are collaborating with NGOs, multi-lateral partners and communities to integrate EbA into the NAP as a cross-cutting solution to this evolving socio-ecological problem.</p>",
