Ethiopia is the ninth largest exporter followed by Uganda (#15), Kenya (#18) and Tanzania (#19). Concerns over the impacts of increasing minimum (or nighttime) temperatures resulting in decreased yields and increased damage from pest already threatens global coffee production.</p><p>Elevations ranging between 1,200 to 1,800 meters (from mean sea level) will feel the most considerable impact in East Africa. The suitable areas for coffee production will transition to higher elevations as temperatures increase, shifting deforestation to new areas.</p>",
