          p 
            span.italic Resilience 
            | refers to the ability of a socio-ecological system to withstand, respond to, and adapt to stresses and shocks. While most of us have an intuitive understanding of resilience, the term also has technical meanings. Resilience often is conceptualized and approached differently by the development, disaster relief, and ecological communities. There is a growing body of scientific literature and community of practice focused on resilience, yet there are surprisingly few quantitative, integrative, multi-scale and data-driven analyses to inform resilience thinking and, particularly, the design of interventions and investments to promote resilience.
          p In this context, we developed RESILIENCE ATLAS as an interactive analytical tool for building (1) understanding of the extent and severity of some of the key stressors and shocks that are affecting rural livelihoods, production systems, and ecosystems in the Sahel, Horn of Africa and South and Southeast Asia; and (2) insights into the ways that different types of wealth and assets (i.e., natural capital, human capital, social capital, financial capital and manufactured capital) – and combinations among these – impact resilience in particular contexts.
          p The RESILIENCE ATLAS database was created by integrating and analyzing more than 12 terabytes of data from over 60 of the best available datasets related to resilience, and summarizing the output in the form of easy to understand maps that can shift focus from regional to national and, where the availability and resolution of the data permit, to local scales. We hope the RESILIENCE ATLAS analytical tool and database provides new insights to help catalyze a revisioning of resilience and support for the growing community of practice around resilience.

            | The RESILIENCE ATLAS analytical tool is structured to enable users to explore assessments of “the resilience of what to what” 
            a.link href="#McCarthy"(Carpenter et al. 2001), 
            | i.e., resilience of particular socio-ecological systems in particular places to which stressors and shocks (e.g., resilience of pastoral systems in Ethiopia to decreasing rainfall and changes in rainfall distribution). We then consider how different types of wealth and assets promote or diminish the resilience of systems to specific stressors and shocks. To follow this framework, we suggest a 3-step approach to gain insights when using RESILIENCE ATLAS.
